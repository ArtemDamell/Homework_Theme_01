# Homework Theme 01
## I came up with a homework assignment for my social media community in 2021.

The client requests to write a program called "Notebook". The payment is fixed - 40â‚¬.

To do this, you need to:

Create several variables of different types to store data:

name;
age;
height;
scores for three subjects: History, Mathematics, English language.
Implement an automatic calculation of the average score for the three subjects specified in point 1.

Implement the ability to print information on the console using string interpolation.

All code should be commented using regular and XML comments.
